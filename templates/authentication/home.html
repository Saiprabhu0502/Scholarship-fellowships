                <h3>Scholarship</h3>
                <p>A scholarship is a type of financial aid intended to assist students in covering the cost of an undergraduate, postgraduate, and research program. It is generally provided to students by the government, universities, or other organizations to help them further their education. Scholarships can come in the form of one-time cheques or provide money to the recipients each semester or academic year and are renewable. Most scholarships are awarded solely based on an application or any qualifications that make a person particularly qualified for the award. Many unusual circumstances, such as a person's last name, status as a single parent, or the fact that they have a handicapping ailment, may qualify them for a scholarship. Students who attend school full-time, have a minimum grade point average (GPA) and can demonstrate financial need may be eligible for more general scholarships offered by countries and states.</p>
